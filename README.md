# Risk-Assessment-and-Loan-Approval
Synthetic Dataset for Risk Assessment and Loan Approval Modeling(Classification and Regression)
This synthetic dataset comprises 20,000 records of personal and financial data, designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for risk assessment. It serves two primary purposes: The dataset includes diverse features such as demographic information, credit history, employment status, income levels, existing debt, and other relevant financial metrics, providing a comprehensive foundation for sophisticated data-driven analysis and decision-making.

Risk Score Regression: To predict a continuous risk score associated with each individual's likelihood of loan default or financial instability.

Binary Classification: To determine the binary outcome of loan approval, indicating whether an applicant is likely to be approved or denied for a loan.
